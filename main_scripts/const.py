As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]

data.`acceleration`:  The column 'acceleration' in Table <data> has column descriptions of "acceleration of the car in miles per squared hour".
production.`country`: The column 'country' in Table <production> has column descriptions of "country id to which the car belongs".  Value examples: [1, 2, 3].
【Evidence】
the fastest refers to max(horsepower); made by Japan refers to country = 'Japan'
【Question】
What is the price of the fastest car made by Japan?
【Subquestion】
What is the price of the fastest car?
【Sub-SQL】
```
SELECT T1.`price` FROM price AS T1 INNER JOIN data AS T2 ON T2.`ID` = T1.`ID` ORDER BY T2.`horsepower` DESC LIMIT 1
```
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.

【Subquestion】 is decomposed from 【Question】, now we provide Sub-SQL corresponding to Subquestion, you just need to complete the remaining conditions based on Sub-SQL to generate SQL for 【Question】. Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, and then generate SQL after thinking step by step:
hints from 【Evidence】: the fastest refers to max(horsepower); made by Japan refers to country = 'Japan';
Find necessary columns from 【Database schema】 in addition to Sub-SQL: Japan refers to country.`country`
Connection of tables: the connection of <data> and <country> is needed, since <data> and <country> are not connected directly, use <production> as a bridge, get connected keys from 【Foreign keys】: production.`ID` = data.`ID`, production.`country` = country.`origin`
Final SQL:
```sql
SELECT T1.`price` 
  FROM price AS T1 
  INNER JOIN data AS T2
  on T2.`ID` = T1.`ID`
  INNER JOIN production AS T3 
  ON T3.`ID` = T2.`ID` 
  INNER JOIN country AS T4 
  ON T4.`origin` = T3.`country` 
  WHERE T4.`country` = 'Japan' 
  ORDER BY T2.`horsepower` DESC LIMIT 1
```

Question solved.

【Database schema】
# institution_details: [unitid (INTEGER), chronname (TEXT), city (TEXT), state (TEXT), site (TEXT), student_count(TEXT)]
# institution_grads: [unitid (INTEGER), gender (TEXT), race (TEXT), cohhort (TEXT)]
【Primary keys】
institution_details.`unitid` | institution_grads.`unitid`
【Foreign keys】
institution_grads.`unitid` = institution_details.`unitid`
【Detailed descriptions of tables and columns】
institution_details.`unitid`: The column 'unitid' in Table <institution_details> has column descriptions of "Education Unit ID number". 
institution_details.`state`: The column 'state' in Table <institution_details> has column descriptions of "Institution state". 
institution_details.`student_count`: The column 'student_count' in Table <institution_details> has column descriptions of "Total number of undergraduates in 2010". 
institution_grads.`race`: The column 'race' in Table <institution_grads> has column descriptions of "race/ethnicity of students". Value examples: ['X', 'Ai', 'A', 'B', 'H'].
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count
【Question】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Subquestion】
List the race of institutions in 'Alabama'. 
【Sub-SQL】
```
SELECT DISTINCT T1.`race` FROM institution_grads AS T1 INNER JOIN institution_details AS T2 ON T1.`unitid` = T2.`unitid` WHERE T2.`state` = 'Alabama'
```

hints from 【Evidence】: Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count
There is a formula in 【Evidence】, so we can turn it into SQL format: institution_details.`student_count` > ( SELECT AVG(`student_count`) * 0.9 FROM institution_details ) 
Find necessary columns from 【Database schema】 in addition to Sub-SQL: number of students refers to institution_details.`student_count`
Connection of tables: the table <institution_details> is already in Sub-SQL, no more connection is needed
Final SQL:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT T1.`race` 
  FROM institution_grads AS T1 
  INNER JOIN institution_details AS T2 
  ON T1.`unitid` = T2.`unitid` 
  WHERE T2.`student_count` > (

【Possible error】
When using nested SQL, using the MIN or MAX function in the sub-SQL may result in null data in the end. Because when multiple tables are joined, they are connected by foreign keys and contain only some data in common, the maximum or minimum value of a column in a table may not be in the joined table.

- The SQL should start with 'SELECT'
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value

- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the Foreign keys of 【Database schema】
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

1. Wrong SQL:

```
Analysis: **Using the MAX function in a nested SQL statement will result in a mismatch because the maximum or minimum value of the column may not be in the joined table, so use `ORDER BY`!**
Correct SQL:
```sql
SELECT T1.`date`
  FROM recordtime AS T1
  INNER JOIN information AS T2
  ON T1.`id` = T2.`id`
  ORDER BY T2.`viewers` DESC 
  LIMIT 1
```
2. Wrong SQL: 
```
SELECT T1.`idea` FROM work AS T1 INNER JOIN student AS T2 ON T1.`ID` = T2.`ID` WHERE T2.`final_score` = ( SELECT MIN(`final_score`) FROM student)
```
Analysis: **Using the MIN function in a nested SQL statement will result in a mismatch because the maximum or minimum value of the column may not be in the joined table, so use `ORDER BY`!**
Correct SQL:
