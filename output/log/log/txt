********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

Eligible free rate for K-12 = `Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`
【Question】
What is the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in the schools in Alameda County?
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:


====================

To answer the question "What is the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in the schools in Alameda County?", we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the target columns**: We need to calculate the eligible free rate for K-12 students, which is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Eligible free rate for K-12} = \frac{\text{Free Meal Count (K-12)}}{\text{Enrollment (K-12)}}
   \]
   We will also need to filter the results to only include schools in Alameda County.

2. **Select the relevant tables**: The relevant tables are `frpm` (which contains the free meal count and enrollment data) and `schools` (which contains the county information). We will join these tables based on the `CDSCode`.

3. **Construct the SQL query**:
   - We will join the `frpm` and `schools` tables on `CDSCode`.
   - We will filter for schools in Alameda County.
   - We will calculate the eligible free rate and use the `MAX` function to find the highest rate.

4. **Final SQL**:
```sql
SELECT MAX(F.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / F.`Enrollment (K-12)`) AS highest_eligible_free_rate
FROM frpm AS F
JOIN schools AS S ON F.`CDSCode` = S.`CDSCode`
WHERE S.`County` = 'Alameda'
AND F.`Enrollment (K-12)` > 0  -- To avoid division by zero
```

### Explanation of the SQL:
- `SELECT MAX(F.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / F.`Enrollment (K-12)`) AS highest_eligible_free_rate`: This selects the maximum eligible free rate calculated from the free meal count and enrollment.
- `FROM frpm AS F JOIN schools AS S ON F.`CDSCode` = S.`CDSCode``: This joins the `frpm` and `schools` tables on the `CDSCode`.
- `WHERE S.`County` = 'Alameda'`: This filters the results to only include schools in Alameda County.
- `AND F.`Enrollment (K-12)` > 0`: This ensures that we do not divide by zero when calculating the eligible free rate.

This SQL query will return the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in schools located in Alameda County.

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]

【Question】
Please list the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 in continuation schools.
【Evidence】
Eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 = `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】


====================

The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. lowest three eligible free rates
2. students aged 5-17
3. continuation schools

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. lowest three eligible free rates --Eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 = `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` **the columns about Free Meal Count and Enrollment are related**
2. students aged 5-17 --This is directly related to the columns about ages 5-17 **the columns about Free Meal Count and Enrollment are related**
3. continuation schools --This refers to the type of school **the columns about School Type are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "lowest three eligible free rates": ["frpm.Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)","frpm.Enrollment (Ages 5-17)","frpm.School Type"],
  "students aged 5-17": ["frpm.Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)","frpm.Enrollment (Ages 5-17)","frpm.Low Grade"],
  "continuation schools": ["frpm.School Type","frpm.CDSCode","frpm.District Name"]

Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:


====================

To answer the question "List the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17", we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the target columns**: We need to calculate the eligible free rates for students aged 5-17, which is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Eligible Free Rate} = \frac{\text{Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)}}{\text{Enrollment (Ages 5-17)}}
   \]
   We will also need to select the `CDSCode` or `School Name` to identify the schools associated with these rates.

2. **Select the relevant columns**: From the `frpm` table, we need:
   - `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)`
   - `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`
   - `CDSCode` or `School Name` for identification.

3. **Calculate the eligible free rates**: We will use the formula to calculate the eligible free rates in the `SELECT` statement.

4. **Filter out schools with zero enrollment**: To avoid division by zero, we should ensure that `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` is not zero.

5. **Order the results**: We need to order the results by the calculated eligible free rate in ascending order to get the lowest rates.

6. **Limit the results**: Finally, we will limit the results to the lowest three rates.

Now, let's construct the SQL query step by step:

### Final SQL Query
```sql
SELECT 
    `CDSCode`, 
    `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` AS eligible_free_rate
FROM 
    frpm
WHERE 
    `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0
ORDER BY 
    eligible_free_rate ASC
LIMIT 3
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- **SELECT**: We select the `CDSCode` and calculate the eligible free rate.
- **FROM**: We are querying from the `frpm` table.
- **WHERE**: We ensure that the enrollment is greater than zero to avoid division by zero.
- **ORDER BY**: We order the results by the calculated eligible free rate in ascending order.
- **LIMIT**: We limit the results to the lowest three eligible free rates.

This SQL query will provide the desired output of the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17.

【correct SQL】


====================

Analysis:
The provided SQL query attempts to calculate the eligible free rate for students aged 5-17 by dividing the `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` by `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`. However, it encounters an error due to the presence of `NULL` values in the `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` column. To resolve this, we need to ensure that both `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` and `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` are not `NULL` before performing the division. We can achieve this by adding conditions to filter out rows where either of these columns is `NULL`.

Correct SQL:
```sql
SELECT `CDSCode`, `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` AS eligible_free_rate 
FROM frpm 
WHERE `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0 AND `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` IS NOT NULL AND `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` IS NOT NULL 
ORDER BY eligible_free_rate ASC 
LIMIT 3
```

【Evidence】
The SQL now includes checks for `NULL` values in both `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` and `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`, ensuring that the division operation is only performed on valid data. This should prevent any errors related to `NULL` values during execution.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】, a 【Question】, a 【Subquesion】 extracted from 【Question】 and a 【Sub-SQL】 for the 【Subquestion】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge, and then generate a complete SQL for the 【Question】 based on 【Sub-SQL】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

====================

To generate the final SQL query for the question, we need to incorporate the conditions from the question into the provided Sub-SQL. The question asks for the lowest three eligible free rates for students aged 5-17 specifically in continuation schools. 

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Sub-SQL**: 
   The provided Sub-SQL calculates the eligible free rate for students aged 5-17 by dividing the `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` by the `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)`. It also filters out records where enrollment is zero or where the counts are NULL.

2. **Adding Conditions from the Question**:
   We need to filter the results to only include continuation schools. This can be done by adding a condition to the `WHERE` clause to check for `School Type = 'Continuation High Schools'`.

3. **Final SQL Construction**:
   We will modify the Sub-SQL to include the additional condition for the school type.

### Final SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT `CDSCode`, 
       `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` / `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` AS eligible_free_rate 
FROM frpm 
WHERE `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` > 0 
  AND `Free Meal Count (Ages 5-17)` IS NOT NULL 
  AND `Enrollment (Ages 5-17)` IS NOT NULL 
  AND `School Type` = 'Continuation High Schools' 
ORDER BY eligible_free_rate ASC NULLS LAST 
LIMIT 3
```

### Explanation of the Final SQL:
- **SELECT Clause**: We select the `CDSCode` and calculate the eligible free rate.
- **FROM Clause**: We are querying from the `frpm` table.
- **WHERE Clause**: We ensure that:
  - Enrollment is greater than zero.
  - Free meal count and enrollment are not NULL.
  - The school type is specifically 'Continuation High Schools'.
- **ORDER BY Clause**: We order the results by the eligible free rate in ascending order, ensuring that NULL values are last.
- **LIMIT Clause**: We limit the results to the lowest three eligible free rates.

This SQL query will provide the desired results as specified in the question.

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

【Evidence】
Charter schools refers to `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the table fprm
【Question】
List the zip code of all the charter schools in Fresno County Office of Education
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:


====================

To answer the question "List the zip code of all the charter schools in Fresno County Office of Education," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: 
   - We need the zip code, which is in the `schools` table (`Zip`).
   - We also need to identify charter schools, which is indicated by the column `Charter School (Y/N)` in the `frpm` table.

2. **Determine the connection between tables**: 
   - The `frpm` table and the `schools` table are connected through the `CDSCode` column, which is a foreign key.

3. **Filter for charter schools and the specific county**: 
   - We need to filter for charter schools where `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1.
   - We also need to filter for schools in Fresno County, which we will assume is represented by the `County Name` in the `frpm` table.

4. **Construct the SQL query**: 
   - We will join the `frpm` and `schools` tables on `CDSCode`.
   - We will apply the necessary filters in the `WHERE` clause.

Here is the SQL query that meets these requirements:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT S.`Zip`
  FROM frpm AS F
  JOIN schools AS S
  ON F.`CDSCode` = S.`CDSCode`
  WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
    AND F.`County Name` = 'Fresno County Office of Education'
```

### Explanation of the SQL:
- `SELECT DISTINCT S.`Zip``: This selects the unique zip codes from the `schools` table.
- `FROM frpm AS F JOIN schools AS S ON F.`CDSCode` = S.`CDSCode``: This joins the `frpm` table with the `schools` table based on the `CDSCode`.
- `WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1`: This filters the results to include only charter schools.
- `AND F.`County Name` = 'Fresno County Office of Education'`: This further filters the results to include only those schools in the specified county.

This query will return the zip codes of all charter schools in the Fresno County Office of Education.

【correct SQL】


====================

Analysis:
The original SQL query attempts to join the `frpm` and `schools` tables to retrieve the zip codes of charter schools in the "Fresno County Office of Education". However, the `County Name` in the `frpm` table does not match the expected value. The correct value for Fresno County should be 'Fresno', not 'Fresno County Office of Education'. Additionally, the `County Code` should be checked to ensure it corresponds to Fresno County, which is typically '19'. 

Correct SQL:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT S.`Zip` 
FROM frpm AS F 
JOIN schools AS S ON F.`CDSCode` = S.`CDSCode` 
WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND F.`County Code` = '19'
```

【Evidence】
The query now correctly filters for charter schools in Fresno County by using the appropriate `County Code`. The `Charter School (Y/N)` column is also correctly checked for value 1, indicating that the school is a charter school.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】, a 【Question】, a 【Subquesion】 extracted from 【Question】 and a 【Sub-SQL】 for the 【Subquestion】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge, and then generate a complete SQL for the 【Question】 based on 【Sub-SQL】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

====================

To generate the final SQL query for the question about listing the zip codes of all charter schools in Fresno County Office of Education, we need to consider the provided sub-SQL and the relevant constraints.

### Analyzing the Sub-SQL
The provided Sub-SQL is:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT S.`Zip` 
FROM frpm AS F 
JOIN schools AS S ON F.`CDSCode` = S.`CDSCode` 
WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
AND F.`County Code` = '19'
```

### Understanding the Components
1. **Charter Schools**: The condition `F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1` indicates that we are filtering for charter schools.
2. **Fresno County Office of Education**: The `County Code` for Fresno County is '19', which is already included in the Sub-SQL.
3. **Zip Code**: We are selecting the `Zip` column from the `schools` table.

### Final SQL Query
Since the Sub-SQL already includes the necessary conditions to filter for charter schools in Fresno County, we can use it directly as our final SQL query without any modifications. 

### Final SQL
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT S.`Zip` 
FROM frpm AS F 
JOIN schools AS S ON F.`CDSCode` = S.`CDSCode` 
WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
AND F.`County Code` = '19'
```

This SQL query effectively retrieves the distinct zip codes of all charter schools located in Fresno County, adhering to the constraints and requirements outlined in the question.

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:


====================

To answer the question "What is the unabbreviated mailing address of the school with the highest FRPM count for K-12 students?", we need to identify the relevant columns from the database schema and construct the SQL query accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Identify Target Columns**:
   - The unabbreviated mailing address consists of:
     - `MailStreet` (the street address)
     - `MailCity` (the mailing city)
     - `MailZip` (the mailing zip code)
   - The highest FRPM count for K-12 students refers to `FRPM Count (K-12)` from the `frpm` table.

2. **Determine the Connection Between Tables**:
   - The `frpm` table is connected to the `schools` table via the `CDSCode` column. We will need to join these two tables.

3. **Construct the SQL Query**:
   - We will first find the maximum FRPM count for K-12 students.
   - Then, we will select the mailing address of the school that has this maximum FRPM count.

### Final SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT T2.`MailStreet`, T2.`MailCity`, T2.`MailZip`
FROM frpm AS T1
JOIN schools AS T2 ON T1.`CDSCode` = T2.`CDSCode`
WHERE T1.`FRPM Count (K-12)` = (
    SELECT MAX(`FRPM Count (K-12)`)
    FROM frpm
)
```

### Explanation of the SQL Query:
- We are selecting the `MailStreet`, `MailCity`, and `MailZip` from the `schools` table (aliased as `T2`).
- We join the `frpm` table (aliased as `T1`) on the `CDSCode` to link the FRPM count with the corresponding school.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include the school(s) with the maximum FRPM count for K-12 students, which is determined by a subquery that selects the maximum value from the `FRPM Count (K-12)` column in the `frpm` table.

This query will return the unabbreviated mailing address of the school with the highest FRPM count for K-12 students.

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**

【Answer】


====================

The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. phone numbers
2. direct charter-funded schools
3. opened after 2000/1/1

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. phone numbers --no related evidence **the columns about phone numbers are related**
2. direct charter-funded schools --Charter schools refers to `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the frpm **the columns about charter schools are related**
3. opened after 2000/1/1 --no related evidence **the columns about opening dates are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "phone numbers": ["schools.Phone", "schools.Ext", "schools.MailZip"],
  "direct charter-funded schools": ["frpm.Charter School (Y/N)", "frpm.Charter Funding Type", "frpm.CDSCode"],
  "opened after 2000/1/1": ["schools.OpenDate", "schools.ClosedDate", "frpm.Academic Year"]
}
```

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:

====================

To answer the question "List the phone numbers of the direct charter-funded schools," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: 
   - We need the phone numbers from the `schools` table, which corresponds to `schools.Phone`.
   - We also need to filter for direct charter-funded schools, which is indicated by the `Charter Funding Type` in the `frpm` table.

2. **Understand the evidence**: 
   - The evidence states that charter schools are identified by `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the `frpm` table. 
   - We need to ensure that we only select those charter schools that are directly funded.

3. **Establish the connection between tables**: 
   - The `frpm` table is connected to the `schools` table via the `CDSCode` column. 
   - We will need to join these two tables to filter the results correctly.

4. **Construct the SQL query**:
   - We will select the `Phone` column from the `schools` table.
   - We will join the `frpm` table to filter for schools that are charter schools and are directly funded.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT S.`Phone`
  FROM schools AS S
  JOIN frpm AS F
  ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode`
  WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
    AND F.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'
```

### Explanation of the SQL:
- `SELECT S.`Phone``: We are selecting the phone numbers from the `schools` table.
- `FROM schools AS S`: We are using the `schools` table and aliasing it as `S`.
- `JOIN frpm AS F ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode``: We are joining the `frpm` table (aliased as `F`) on the `CDSCode` to connect the two tables.
- `WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1`: This condition filters for charter schools.
- `AND F.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'`: This additional condition ensures that we only include schools that are directly funded.

This query will return the phone numbers of all direct charter-funded schools.

```
【SQLite error】 
exist None value, you can add `IS NOT NULL` in SQL
【Exception class】


Now please fixup old SQL and generate new SQL again.
【correct SQL】


====================

Analysis:
The original SQL query attempts to select phone numbers from the `schools` table for charter-funded schools based on the `Charter School (Y/N)` and `Charter Funding Type` columns in the `frpm` table. However, it encounters an error due to the presence of `None` values in the `Phone` column. To resolve this, we need to add a condition to ensure that the `Phone` column is not null. 

Correct SQL:
```sql
SELECT S.`Phone` 
FROM schools AS S 
JOIN frpm AS F ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode` 
WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
AND F.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded' 
AND S.`Phone` IS NOT NULL
```

【Evidence】
The condition `S.Phone IS NOT NULL` ensures that only schools with valid phone numbers are included in the results, thus preventing the error related to `None` values.

********************


Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】, a 【Question】, a 【Subquesion】 extracted from 【Question】 and a 【Sub-SQL】 for the 【Subquestion】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge, and then generate a complete SQL for the 【Question】 based on 【Sub-SQL】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

data.`ID` = price.`ID`
production.`ID` = price.`ID`
production.`ID` = data.`ID`
production.`country` = country.`origin`
【Detailed descriptions of tables and columns】
country.`origin`: The column 'origin' in Table <country> has column descriptions of "the unique identifier for the origin country". Value examples: [1, 2, 3].
country.`country`: The column 'country' in Table <country> has column descriptions of "the origin country of the car". Value examples: ['USA', 'Japan', 'Europe'].
data.`horsepower`:  The column 'horsepower' in Table <data> has column descriptions of "horse power associated with the car".
data.`acceleration`:  The column 'acceleration' in Table <data> has column descriptions of "acceleration of the car in miles per squared hour".
production.`country`: The column 'country' in Table <production> has column descriptions of "country id to which the car belongs".  Value examples: [1, 2, 3].
【Evidence】
the fastest refers to max(horsepower); made by Japan refers to country = 'Japan'
【Question】
What is the price of the fastest car made by Japan?
【Subquestion】

【Sub-SQL】
```
SELECT T1.`price` FROM price AS T1 INNER JOIN data AS T2 ON T2.`ID` = T1.`ID` ORDER BY T2.`horsepower` DESC LIMIT 1
```
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.

【Subquestion】 is decomposed from 【Question】, now we provide Sub-SQL corresponding to Subquestion, you just need to complete the remaining conditions based on Sub-SQL to generate SQL for 【Question】. Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, and then generate SQL after thinking step by step:
hints from 【Evidence】: the fastest refers to max(horsepower); made by Japan refers to country = 'Japan';
Find necessary columns from 【Database schema】 in addition to Sub-SQL: Japan refers to country.`country`
Connection of tables: the connection of <data> and <country> is needed, since <data> and <country> are not connected directly, use <production> as a bridge, get connected keys from 【Foreign keys】: production.`ID` = data.`ID`, production.`country` = country.`origin`
Final SQL:
```sql
SELECT T1.`price` 
  FROM price AS T1 
  INNER JOIN data AS T2
  on T2.`ID` = T1.`ID`
  INNER JOIN production AS T3 
  ON T3.`ID` = T2.`ID`

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```

【Answer】


====================

The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. phone numbers
2. direct charter-funded schools
3. opened after 2000/1/1

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. phone numbers --no related evidence **the columns about phone numbers are related**
2. direct charter-funded schools --Charter schools refers to `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the frpm **the columns about charter schools are related**
3. opened after 2000/1/1 --no related evidence **the columns about opening dates are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "phone numbers": ["schools.Phone", "schools.Ext", "schools.CDSCode"],
  "direct charter-funded schools": ["frpm.Charter School (Y/N)", "frpm.Charter Funding Type", "frpm.CDSCode"],
  "opened after 2000/1/1": ["schools.OpenDate", "schools.ClosedDate", "frpm.Academic Year"]
}

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

【Evidence】
Charter schools refers to `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the frpm
【Question】
List the phone numbers of the direct charter-funded schools
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:


====================

To answer the question "List the phone numbers of the direct charter-funded schools," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: 
   - We need the phone numbers from the `schools` table, which corresponds to `schools.Phone`.
   - We also need to filter for direct charter-funded schools, which is indicated by the `Charter Funding Type` in the `frpm` table.

2. **Understand the evidence**: 
   - The evidence states that charter schools are identified by `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the `frpm` table. 
   - We need to find those that are directly funded, which implies we should look for `Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'.

3. **Establish the connection between tables**: 
   - The `frpm` table is connected to the `schools` table through the `CDSCode` column. We will need to join these two tables to get the necessary information.

4. **Construct the SQL query**: 
   - We will select the phone numbers from the `schools` table where the corresponding entries in the `frpm` table indicate that the school is a charter school and is directly funded.

Here’s the SQL query that meets these requirements:

```sql
SELECT S.`Phone`
  FROM schools AS S
  JOIN frpm AS F
  ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode`
  WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
    AND F.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'
```

### Explanation of the SQL:
- **SELECT S.`Phone`**: We are selecting the phone numbers from the `schools` table.
- **FROM schools AS S**: We are using the `schools` table and aliasing it as `S`.
- **JOIN frpm AS F ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode`**: We are joining the `frpm` table (aliased as `F`) on the `CDSCode` to connect the two tables.
- **WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1**: This condition filters for charter schools.
- **AND F.`Charter Funding Type` = 'Directly funded'**: This condition ensures we only get those charter schools that are directly funded.

This SQL query will return the phone numbers of all direct charter-funded schools.

【correct SQL】


====================

Analysis:
The original SQL query attempts to select phone numbers from the `schools` table for charter-funded schools based on the `frpm` table. However, it encounters an error due to the presence of `None` values in the `Phone` column. To resolve this, we need to add a condition to filter out any `None` values from the `Phone` column. Additionally, the condition for `Charter Funding Type` is not necessary for the task, as the query only requires charter-funded schools.

Correct SQL:
```sql
SELECT S.`Phone` FROM schools AS S JOIN frpm AS F ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode` WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND S.`Phone` IS NOT NULL
```

【Evidence】
The query now correctly filters for charter schools (where `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1) and ensures that the `Phone` column does not contain `None` values, thus preventing any errors related to null values.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】, a 【Question】, a 【Subquesion】 extracted from 【Question】 and a 【Sub-SQL】 for the 【Subquestion】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge, and then generate a complete SQL for the 【Question】 based on 【Sub-SQL】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.

【Subquestion】 is decomposed from 【Question】, now we provide Sub-SQL corresponding to Subquestion, you just need to complete the remaining conditions based on Sub-SQL to generate SQL for 【Question】. Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, and then generate SQL after thinking step by step:


====================

To generate the final SQL query for the question, we need to incorporate the additional condition from the question regarding the opening date of the schools. The evidence indicates that we are looking for direct charter-funded schools, which is already reflected in the Sub-SQL. 

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Sub-SQL**: 
   The provided Sub-SQL is:
   ```sql
   SELECT S.`Phone` FROM schools AS S JOIN frpm AS F ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode` WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 AND S.`Phone` IS NOT NULL 
   ```
   This query selects the phone numbers of charter schools where the phone number is not null.

2. **Adding the Additional Condition**: 
   The question specifies that we need to filter for schools that opened after January 1, 2000. This means we need to add a condition to check the `OpenDate` in the `schools` table.

3. **Final SQL Construction**:
   We will modify the Sub-SQL to include the condition for the `OpenDate`. The condition will be:
   ```sql
   S.`OpenDate` > '2000-01-01'
   ```

4. **Final SQL Query**:
   Combining everything, the final SQL query will look like this:
   ```sql
   SELECT S.`Phone` 
   FROM schools AS S 
   JOIN frpm AS F ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode` 
   WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
   AND S.`Phone` IS NOT NULL 
   AND S.`OpenDate` > '2000-01-01'
   ```

### Complete SQL:
```sql
SELECT S.`Phone` 
FROM schools AS S 
JOIN frpm AS F ON S.`CDSCode` = F.`CDSCode` 
WHERE F.`Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 
AND S.`Phone` IS NOT NULL

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

List the number of schools with an average score in Math under 400 in the SAT test

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:


====================

To answer the question "List the number of schools with an average score in Math under 400 in the SAT test," we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: 
   - We need to select the average score in Math, which corresponds to `AvgScrMath` from the `satscores` table.
   - We also need to count the number of schools that meet the criteria.

2. **Determine the condition**: 
   - The condition is that the average score in Math must be under 400.

3. **Identify the tables involved**: 
   - The relevant table for this query is `satscores`, as it contains the average scores.

4. **Formulate the SQL query**:
   - We will use the `COUNT` function to count the number of schools with an average score in Math under 400.
   - We will apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results based on the average score.

5. **Final SQL**:
   - Since we only need to count the number of schools, we do not need to join with any other tables.

Here is the SQL query that meets the requirements:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS number_of_schools
  FROM satscores
  WHERE AvgScrMath < 400
```

This query counts all entries in the `satscores` table where the average score in Math is less than 400, providing the total number of such schools. 

**Question Solved.**

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】, a 【Question】, a 【Subquesion】 extracted from 【Question】 and a 【Sub-SQL】 for the 【Subquestion】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge, and then generate a complete SQL for the 【Question】 based on 【Sub-SQL】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:
【Question】: What is the fastest car made by Japan?
Targets for `SELECT`: the name of the fastest car
hints from 【Evidence】: the fastest refers to max(horsepower); name of the car refers to car_name
For the entities in the 【Question】, get corresponding columns from 【Database schema】 with hints: car refers to data.`car_name`, the fastest refers to MAX(data.`horsepower`), Japan refers to country.`country`
Connection of tables: includes tables <data> and <country>, since <data> and <country> are not connected directly, use <production> as a bridge, get connected keys from 【Foreign keys】: production.`ID` = data.`ID`, production.`country` = country.`origin`
Final SQL:
```sql
SELECT T1.`car_name` 
  FROM data AS T1 
  INNER JOIN production AS T2 
  ON T1.`ID` = T2.`ID` 
  INNER JOIN country AS T3 
  ON T3.`origin` = T2.`country` 
  WHERE T3.`country` = 'Japan' 
  ORDER BY T1.`horsepower` DESC LIMIT 1

# institution_details: [unitid (INTEGER), chronname (TEXT), city (TEXT), state (TEXT), site (TEXT), student_count(TEXT)]
# institution_grads: [unitid (INTEGER), gender (TEXT), race (TEXT), cohhort (TEXT)]
【Primary keys】
institution_details.`unitid` | institution_grads.`unitid`
【Foreign keys】
institution_grads.`unitid` = institution_details.`unitid`
【Detailed descriptions of tables and columns】
institution_details.`unitid`: The column 'unitid' in Table <institution_details> has column descriptions of "Education Unit ID number". 
institution_details.`chronname`: The column 'chronname' in Table <institution_details> has column descriptions of "Institution name". 
institution_details.`student_count`: The column 'student_count' in Table <institution_details> has column descriptions of "Total number of undergraduates in 2010". 
【Evidence】
number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count
【Question】
List the chronname of institutions with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:
【Question】: List the chroname of institutions with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
Targets for `SELECT`: the chroname of institutions
hints from 【Evidence】: number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count
There is a formula in 【Evidence】, so we can turn it into SQL format: institution_details.`student_count` > ( SELECT AVG(`student_count`) * 0.9 FROM institution_details ) 
For the entities in the 【Question】, get corresponding columns from 【Database schema】 with hints: the chronname of institutions refers to institution_details.`chronname`, number of students refers to institution_details.`student_count`
Connection of tables: include only one table <institution_details>, no connection
Final SQL:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `chroname`
  FROM institution_details
  WHERE `student_count` > ( 
    SELECT AVG(`student_count`) * 0.9 FROM institution_details

As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Primary keys】
account.`account_id` | client.`client_id` | loan.`loan_id` | district.`district_id`
【Foreign keys】
client.`district_id` = district.`district_id`
【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
==========

【Query】
What is the qualification rate for the H-11 products produced in 2023/11/2?
【Evidence】
qualification rate = `Numqualified(H-11)` / `production(H-11)`

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products
Conditions:
1. produced in 2023/11/2 --Condition_1

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products produced in 2023/11/2

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions

Which president got a higher approval rating, Joseph Biden or Donald Trump?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump

Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========
【DB_ID】 banking_system
【Schema】
# Table: account
[
  (account_id <INTEGER>, the id of the account. Value examples: [11382, 11362, 2, 1, 2367].),

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
==========

【Query】
What is the qualification rate for the H-11 products produced in 2023/11/2?

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions

Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.

********************


Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Foreign keys】
client.`district_id` = district.`district_id`
【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
==========

【Query】
What is the qualification rate for the H-11 products produced in 2023/11/2?
【Evidence】
qualification rate = `Numqualified(H-11)` / `production(H-11)`

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products
Conditions:
1. produced in 2023/11/2 --Condition_1

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products produced in 2023/11/2

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions

【Query】
Which president got a higher approval rating, Joseph Biden or Donald Trump?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump
Conditions: 
NULL

Subqueries: 
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump

【Query】
For movie id 1269, how many users, who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial when he rated the movie, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the number of users
Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========

# Table: account
[
  (account_id <INTEGER>, the id of the account. Value examples: [11382, 11362, 2, 1, 2367].),

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
==========

【Query】
What is the qualification rate for the H-11 products produced in 2023/11/2?
【Evidence】
qualification rate = `Numqualified(H-11)` / `production(H-11)`

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products
Conditions:
1. produced in 2023/11/2 --Condition_1

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products produced in 2023/11/2

==========

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions

【Query】
Which president got a higher approval rating, Joseph Biden or Donald Trump?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump
Conditions: 
NULL

Subqueries: 
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump

==========

【Query】
For movie id 1269, how many users, who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial when he rated the movie, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the number of users
Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】

1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

For the entities in the 【Question】, get corresponding columns from 【Database schema】 with hints: the stadium name refers to stadium.`Name`, the number of concerts refers to COUNT(concert.`concert_ID`), each stadium refers to stadium.`Stadium_ID`
Connection of tables: include tables <stadium> and <concert>, get connected keys from 【Foreign keys】: concert.`Stadium_ID` = stadium.`Stadium_ID`
Final SQL:
```sql
SELECT T1.`Name`, COUNT(T2.concert_ID) AS num_concerts
  FROM stadium AS T1
  JOIN concert AS T2
  ON T1.`Stadium_ID` = T2.`Stadium_ID`

As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Foreign keys】
client.`district_id` = district.`district_id`
【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
==========

【Query】
What is the qualification rate for the H-11 products produced in 2023/11/2?
【Evidence】
qualification rate = `Numqualified(H-11)` / `production(H-11)`

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products
Conditions:
1. produced in 2023/11/2 --Condition_1

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products produced in 2023/11/2

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions

【Query】
Which president got a higher approval rating, Joseph Biden or Donald Trump?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump
Conditions: 
NULL

Subqueries: 
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump

【Query】
For movie id 1269, how many users, who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial when he rated the movie, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the number of users
Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========
【DB_ID】 banking_system
【Schema】
# Table: account
[
  (account_id <INTEGER>, the id of the account. Value examples: [11382, 11362, 2, 1, 2367].),

  (date <DATE>, the date when the loan is approved. Value examples: ['1998-07-12', '1998-04-19'].),
  (amount <INTEGER>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: [1567, 7877, 9988].),
  (duration <INTEGER>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: [60, 48, 24, 12, 36].),
  (payments <INTEGER>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: [3456, 8972, 9845].),
  (status <TEXT>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: ['C', 'A', 'D', 'B'].)

【Foreign keys】
client.`district_id` = district.`district_id`
【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula

Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you to generate SQL (Matched values may contain useless information and you should ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.

Consider 【Constraints】, extract hints from 【Evidence】 if 【Evidence】 is related to the 【Question】, select columns from 【Database schema】 and then generate SQL for 【Question】, you need to think step by step:
【Question】: List the chroname of institutions with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
Targets for `SELECT`: the chroname of institutions
hints from 【Evidence】: number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count
There is a formula in 【Evidence】, so we can turn it into SQL format: institution_details.`student_count` > ( SELECT AVG(`student_count`) * 0.9 FROM institution_details ) 
For the entities in the 【Question】, get corresponding columns from 【Database schema】 with hints: the chronname of institutions refers to institution_details.`chronname`, number of students refers to institution_details.`student_count`
Connection of tables: include only one table <institution_details>, no connection
Final SQL:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT `chroname`
  FROM institution_details
  WHERE `student_count` > ( 
    SELECT AVG(`student_count`) * 0.9 FROM institution_details
  ) 
```

Question Solved.

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========

# Table: account
[
  (account_id <INTEGER>, the id of the account. Value examples: [11382, 11362, 2, 1, 2367].),

# Table: loan
[
  (loan_id <INTEGER>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: [4959, 4960, 4961].),
  (account_id <INTEGER>, the id number identifying the account. Value examples: [10, 80, 55, 43].),
  (date <DATE>, the date when the loan is approved. Value examples: ['1998-07-12', '1998-04-19'].),
  (amount <INTEGER>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: [1567, 7877, 9988].),
  (duration <INTEGER>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: [60, 48, 24, 12, 36].),
  (payments <INTEGER>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: [3456, 8972, 9845].),
  (status <TEXT>, the id number identifying the loan data. Value examples: ['C', 'A', 'D', 'B'].)
]
# Table: district
[

【Primary keys】
account.`account_id` | client.`client_id` | loan.`loan_id` | district.`district_id`
【Foreign keys】
client.`district_id` = district.`district_id`
【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
==========

【Query】
What is the qualification rate for the H-11 products produced in 2023/11/2?
【Evidence】
qualification rate = `Numqualified(H-11)` / `production(H-11)`

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products
Conditions:
1. produced in 2023/11/2 --Condition_1

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products produced in 2023/11/2

==========

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions

【Query】
Which president got a higher approval rating, Joseph Biden or Donald Trump?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump
Conditions: 
NULL

Subqueries: 
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump

==========

【Query】
For movie id 1269, how many users, who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial when he rated the movie, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the number of users
Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========
【DB_ID】 banking_system
【Schema】
# Table: account
[
  (account_id <INTEGER>, the id of the account. Value examples: [11382, 11362, 2, 1, 2367].),

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
==========

【Query】
What is the qualification rate for the H-11 products produced in 2023/11/2?

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products
Conditions:
1. produced in 2023/11/2 --Condition_1

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products produced in 2023/11/2

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions

【Query】
Which president got a higher approval rating, Joseph Biden or Donald Trump?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump
Conditions: 
NULL

Subqueries: 
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump

Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

【Foreign keys】
client.`district_id` = district.`district_id`
【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```

********************


[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
==========

【Query】
What is the qualification rate for the H-11 products produced in 2023/11/2?
【Evidence】
qualification rate = `Numqualified(H-11)` / `production(H-11)`

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products
Conditions:
1. produced in 2023/11/2 --Condition_1

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products produced in 2023/11/2

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions

【Query】
Which president got a higher approval rating, Joseph Biden or Donald Trump?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump
Conditions: 
NULL

Subqueries: 
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the name of the president who got a higher approval rating between Joseph Biden or Donald Trump

【Query】
For movie id 1269, how many users, who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial when he rated the movie, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2?
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the number of users
Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========

# Table: account
[
  (account_id <INTEGER>, the id of the account. Value examples: [11382, 11362, 2, 1, 2367].),

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
}
```
Question Solved.

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Here are some examples:
==========

【Query】
Show the stadium name and the number of concerts in each stadium. Please also list the year the stadium was built. 
【Evidence】
NULL

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium
Conditions: NULL

Subqueries:
1. Since Conditions is NULL, the final Subquery is the Targets.
##Subquery: List the stadium name, the year the stadium built and the number of concerts in each stadium

Targets: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products
Conditions:
1. produced in 2023/11/2 --Condition_1

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the qualification rate for the H-11 Products produced in 2023/11/2

【Query】
List the race of institutions in Alabama with number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions?
【Evidence】
Alabama refers to state = 'Alabama'; number of students greater than the 90% of average = MULTIPLY(AVG(student_count), 90%) < student_count

【Decomposition】
Targets: List the race of institutions
Conditions: 
1. in Alabama --Condition_1
2. number of students greater than the 90% of average number of students of all institutions --Condition_2

Subqueries:
1. Combine Targets and Condition_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the race of institution in Alabama
2. Conbine the first Subquery and Conditon_2 to get the seconed Subquery.

Conditions:
1. was a paying subscriber --Condition_1
2. was eligible for trial --Condition_2
3. for movie id 1269, gave the movie a rating score of less than or equal to 2 --Condition3

Subquerys:
1. Combine Targets and Conditon_1 to get the first Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber
2. Combine the first Subquery and Condition_2 to get the second Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial
3. Combine the second Subquery and Condition_3 to get the third Subquery.
##Subquery: List the number of users who was a paying subscriber and was eligible for trial and gave the movie whose id is 1269 a rating score of less than or equal to 2

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

Here is a typical example:

==========

2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:

【Answer】


====================

The entities extracted from the question are:

1. highest eligible free rate
2. K-12 students
3. schools
4. Alameda County

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities:

1. highest eligible free rate -- Eligible free rate for K-12 = `Free Meal Count (K-12)` / `Enrollment (K-12)`
2. K-12 students -- Enrollment (K-12) and Free Meal Count (K-12) are relevant
3. schools -- Relevant columns include CDSCode and County Name
4. Alameda County -- County Name or County column in the database

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:

[Instruction]
Given a 【query】, you need to understanding the intent of Query, and then deceompose it into Targets and Conditions. Then you need to combine Targets and Conditions into Subquerys step by step. 
For the case where Conditions is NULL, consider Targets as the final Subquery directly. 
For the case where Conditions are not NULL, combine Targets and the first Condition to get the first Subquery, then combine this Subquery and the next Condition into a new Subquery until all Conditions are used (which means the content of the last Subquery and the original Query is the same).

[Requirements]
-Try not to overlap Targets and Conditions.
-Make sure the decomposed Target and Condition can cover all of the information in Query.
-Don't change any information (specific value) in Query!
-Mark each Subquery with ## in front of it.

Given a 【Database schema】 description, a knowledge 【Evidence】and a 【Question】, you need to use valid SQLite and understand the database and knowledge so that you can generate a good SQL for the 【Question】.
When generating SQL, we should always consider constraints:
【Constraints】
- In `SELECT <column>`, just select needed columns in the 【Question】 without any unnecessary column or value
- In `FROM <table>` or `JOIN <table>`, do not include unnecessary table
- If use max or min func, `JOIN <table>` FIRST, THEN use `SELECT MAX(<column>)` or `SELECT MIN(<column>)`
- If [Value examples] of <column> has 'None' or None, use `JOIN <table>` or `WHERE <column> is NOT NULL` is better
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC|DESC`, add `GROUP BY <column>` before to select distinct values
- If include more than one table, use `JOIN <table>`
- If use `JOIN <table>`, the connected columns should be in the 【Foreign keys】
- If evidence gives a formula for calculating a value, try to use that formula
- If use `ORDER BY <column> ASC LIMIT <n>`, please use `ORDER BY <column> ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT <n>` to make sure the null values will not be selected

====================

To answer the question "What is the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in the schools in Alameda County?", we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relevant columns**: 
   - The eligible free rate for K-12 is calculated using the formula: `Free Meal Count (K-12) / Enrollment (K-12)`.
   - We need to select the maximum of this calculated value.
   - We also need to filter the results to only include schools in Alameda County.

2. **Identify the tables involved**: 
   - We will use the `frpm` table to filter by county and to access the `Free Meal Count (K-12)` and `Enrollment (K-12)` columns.
   - We will also need to join with the `schools` table to ensure we are only considering schools in Alameda County.

3. **Establish the connection between tables**: 
   - The `frpm` table is connected to the `schools` table through the `CDSCode` column.

4. **Construct the SQL query**:
   - We will calculate the eligible free rate and then find the maximum value for schools in Alameda County.

Here is the SQL query that accomplishes this:

```sql
SELECT MAX(FRM.`Free Meal Count (K-12)` / FRM.`Enrollment (K-12)`) AS highest_eligible_free_rate
FROM frpm AS FRM
JOIN schools AS SCH ON FRM.`CDSCode` = SCH.`CDSCode`
WHERE FRM.`County Name` = 'Alameda'
```

### Explanation of the SQL:
- We are selecting the maximum eligible free rate calculated from the `Free Meal Count (K-12)` divided by `Enrollment (K-12)`.
- We join the `frpm` table with the `schools` table on the `CDSCode` to ensure we are looking at the correct schools.
- We filter the results to only include those from Alameda County.

This SQL query will return the highest eligible free rate for K-12 students in schools located in Alameda County.

********************


As an experienced and professional database administrator, your task is to analyze a user question and a database schema to provide relevant information. The database schema consists of table descriptions, each containing multiple column descriptions. Your goal is to extract the entities from question and identify the relevant tables and columns based on these entities and the evidence provided.

[Instruction]:
1. Extract the mentioned entities from the user question. Make sure all of the entities are extracted. 
2. For each entity, keep at least 3 related columns.
4. Your output should include entity extraction, analysis and related database schema.
5. The related database schema should be in JSON format.
6. Each column's information in provided 【Schema】 is in this format: (column, description. Value examples<optional>)

[Requirements]:
1. Sort the related columns in each list corresponding to each entity in descending order of relevance.
2. The chosen columns should be in this format: <table.column>.
3. Make sure each chosen list is not empty. The value [] will be punished. 
4.【Matched values】 may contain redundant or useless information in addition to the correct matching values, so you need to select the useful information in conjunction with the specific column names and descriptions.
5. An entity may not have a corresponding evidence, which requires you to find the relevant columns yourself through your understanding of the database schema.

【Question】
What is the gender of the youngest client who opened account in the lowest average salary branch and when did this client open the account? Please list their full name.
【Evidence】
Later birthdate refers to younger age; A11 refers to average salary; Full name refers to first_name, last_name
【Matched values】
Since some of the specific values in Question and evidence match the data in the database, here are some matches retrieved from the database that may help you in selecting columns (You need to ignore matches that are not relevant to the question):
No matched values.
【Answer】
The entities extracted from the 【Question】 are: 
1. gender; 
2. youngest client; 
3. account; 
4. lowest average salary branch; 
5. when did this client open the account; 
6. full name

Extract the related evidence in 【Evidence】 for entities if 【Evidence】 is not None: 
1. gender --no related evidence **the columns about gender are related**
2. youngest client  --Later birthdate refers to younger age; **the columns about birth date of client and the id of client are related**
3. account --no related evidence **the columns about account or account ids are related**
4. lowest average salary branch  --A11 refers to average salary **the columns about average salary and branch are related**
5. when did this client open the account --no related evidence **the columns about time or date of the account are related**
6. full name  --Full name refers to first_name, last_name **the columns about first_name, last_name of the client are related**

Therefore, we can select the related database schema based on these entities with 【Evidence】:
```json
{
  "gender": ["client.gender","client.client_id","loan.status"],
  "youngest client": ["client.birth_date","client.client_id","account.date","loan.date"],
  "account": ["account.account_id","loan.account_id","account.date"],
  "lowest average salary branch": ["district.A11","district.district_id","district.A13"],
  "when did this client open the account": ["account.date","loan.date","client.birth_date"],
  "full name": ["client.first_name","client.last_name","client.client_id"]
